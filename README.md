# PolyhedralRelaxations.jl

UnivariatePolyhedralRelaxations.jl is a Julia package to construct mixed-integer linear programming and linear programming (MILP and LP) relaxations for univariate, continuous, and differentiable functions whose domain is also bounded. The package constructs the relaxations and returns a sparse matrix A and column vector b with additional details on what each variable represents and whether the variable is continuous or binary.
